# Tavi's Bot Template
This project has been designed as a template. It is not meant to be used as a standalone project. If you want to contribute a new default module, create a new branch and pull request. Command pull requests will be ignored, unless they are fixing a bug. When creating a copy, it is recommended that you replace the contents of this README with something else. However, credit is greatly appreciated.

# Modules
This project is designed to be modular. This means that you can add and remove modules as you see fit. The following modules are included by default:
| Module | Description | Path | Authors |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Loader | Loads all other modules | `functions/load.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |
| Sequelize Database | Connects to a MySQL database | `functions/init/database.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |
| Error Hook | Attaches to common error events and logs them | `functions/init/errorHook.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |
| Pino Logs | Logs to a JSON file instead of the console | `functions/init/pino.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |
| Command Loader | Searches in commands folder for commands | `functions/ready/commands.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |
| Instatus Latency Metric | Posts latency to Instatus | `functions/ready/latency.ts` | [totallytavi](https://github.com/totallytavi) |

Disabling is as simple as renaming the file extension since the core loader scans for `.js` files
> [!TIP]
> Executing a module's content can be done by finding it with `client.TYPE.FOLDER_NAME.get('PATH')` where TYPE is the kind of file it is (Command, function, or event). If a file is in a subdirectory of FOLDER_NAME, it can be found with `FOLDER/FILE`. Do not use extensions

## Functions
The structure for a function module is as follows:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For events, a different structure is used. See the Events section for more information.

```ts
import { CustomClient } from '../../typings/Extensions.ts';

export const name = 'name';
export async function execute(client: CustomClient, ready: boolean): Promise<void> {
  // Code here
}
```
Ready is a variable that is used to determine whether the bot has finished all loading and is ready to process events. It is usually set to `true` in the command loader. By default it is false so if the command loader is disabled, you must set it to true somewhere else

## Events
Events are not automatically imported. This is to allow you to pick which events you wish to receive. To import an event, create a new file in the `events` folder. The structure for an event is as follows:
> [!TIP]
> If you want to dynamically import events, you can use `client.eventNames()` to get all events the client can emit.
```ts
import { CustomClient } from '../../../typings/Extensions.js';
// You are responsible for importing event typings
import { GuildMember } from 'discord.js';

export const name = 'example';
/**
 * For the sake of an example, let's say that
 * this handler is for guildMemberAdd
 */
export async function execute(
  client: CustomClient, member: GuildMember
): Promise<void> {
  // Logic goes here
}
```
When an event handler is executed, it will be passed all the parameters that the event emits in a spread operator. For example, if the event emits `oldMember, newMember` (like `guildMemberUpdate`), the handler will be passed `client, oldMember, newMember` (Since client is always passed first)

## Commands
All command files must be placed in the `commands` folder. The structure for a command is as follows:
```ts
import { ChatInputCommandInteraction, SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';
import { CustomClient } from '../typings/Extensions.js';

export const name = 'commandName';
export const ephemeral = false;
export const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName(name)
  .setDescription('Description');
export async function run(
  client: CustomClient,
  interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction,
  options: ChatInputCommandInteraction['options']
): Promise<void> {
  // Code goes here
}
```
The `ephemeral` property is optional and defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the command will only be visible to the user who ran it.

# Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is tested with Node 20.19.0. Later and earlier versions may work, but are not guaranteed to. If you encounter any issues and know how to solve them, please open a pull request.

To use this project, you must perform the following steps in order.
1. Clone from GitHub
```bash
git clone https://github.com/totallytavi/BotTemplate.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Duplicate all `...-example.json` files in `config`, but remove the `-example`
4. Fill in all values. You may need to specify the schema to receive proper IntelliSense.
5. Compile the files
```bash
npm run build
```
6. Run the bot
```bash
# Node may emit ExperimentalWarning
node index.js --no-warnings
```

# Contributing
## Features
If you wish to contribute, any help is greatly appreciated. Please make sure you're not creating a very specific feature that could only apply to your bot. If you want to add a feature that you think could be useful to others, create a new branch and pull request. For features specific to your bot, consider using the project as a template.

## Security 
If any vulnerabilities are found, please open a private issue. All fixes should be placed in the thread that GitHub opens to keep vulnerabilities private. We will always credit you. Thank you for helping keep this project secure.
